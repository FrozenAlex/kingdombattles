Today's Bug Fixes
---
_6 June 2019_

* Train, untrain, purchase, sell are no longer possible while spying.
* Equipment page no longer vanishes when you press a button.

I'll need to implement or set up a proper bug tracker. It's on the list.

I'm not doing any heavy coding today, besides emergency bug fixes like those listed above. I'm taking the day off. Please continue to report any major bugs in my discord: https://discord.gg/FQmz8TN

I'm also contacting an artist to begin drawing the badge images.
