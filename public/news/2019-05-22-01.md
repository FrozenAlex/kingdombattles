Hello World!

_22 May 2019_

Oh, um... OK, let's start then! Welcome to Kingdom Battles where you can fight for your life and the honour of being at the top of the ladder! Well, as soon as the ladder is implemented...

Right now, you can build up your gold and your army! You can gain a new recruit once per day, and you gain 1 gold every half hour for every recruit you have. You can spend that gold to train your recruits as soldiers, spies or scientists, each of which will have their own purposes in the game. But remember: You only gain gold from recruits - once you train them, they're no longer working in the fields!

You can peek at the developer's account [here](profile?username=Ratstail91). Don't get discouraged! My account probably won't appear on the ladder once the game is in a more complete state, so don't worry about catching up to me.

Check back often for more information! In the mean time, here are my social media links!
