The Colossal Fuckup
---
_11 June 2019_

I am so sorry.

I am so fucking sorry.

I opened the database to fix a bug (it seems the negative gold bug lives on), and... I set everyone's gold to 0.

I really messed up the game, and I take full responsibility. I understand fully if you decide not to continue playing this game.

There is a backup, from earlier today, but the gold moves around way too fast for that backup to be of any use. So, to patch my error, I've given everyone 130 gold. This will mean that it'll take several days before spoils reach their pre-fuckup sizes, but it will naturally balance out.

There are quality of life features that I've been planning to implement, however this mistake shows that I really need the administration tools as soon as possible.

Again, I am so, so sorry.
