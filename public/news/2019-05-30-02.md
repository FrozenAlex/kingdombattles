Negative Gold - Network Latency
---
_30 May 2019_

So, I *think* the negative gold bug was caused by network latency, which is why it was so hard to track down. I've added some protections for it, but I'll also be on the lookout for this bug reoccuring, since it's so tricky to nail down.

As a thank you for putting up with the bugs, I'm going to award 100 gold to everyone. This should also make combat a little more interesting for everyone too.

I've also had reports that some people aren't getting their spoils from attacks, and the logs back this up. I'm investigating this. If you suffer this bug, please report it via my discord here: [https://discord.gg/FQmz8TN](https://discord.gg/FQmz8TN)
