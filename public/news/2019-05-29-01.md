Button, Button, Who's Got The Button?

OK, the attack button is now visible on other people's profiles. This isn't active yet because I've only been working on the client code - next up is the server and game code.

The plan is this:

* You can attack another player using your soldiers (it doesn't work without soldiers).
* Doing so takes time, up to 10 seconds for every soldier you have.
* Combat takes place at the end of the time delay, at which point you can attack people again (after reloading the page).
* While attacking, you are undefended.
* While undefended, your recruits act as combatants, otherwise your soldiers do.
* The chance of success is determined by the ratio of each side's combatant strength.
* Recruits have a strength equal to 0.25 times that of a soldier.
* On a success, you steal 10% of the target's gold. On a failure, you steal 2% of the target's gold.
* The attacking force will lose a percentage, rounded down, of their units - 5% on a success, 10% on a failure.

All of these numbers can be adjusted later, but this is the initial gameplan for combat.
