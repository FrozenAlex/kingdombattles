_30 May 2019_

So changes I've made today:

* Both incoming and outgoing combats are now visible.
* Google analytics implemented.
* The game ladder can now point to a specific rank with the URL: [https://kingdombattles.net/ladder?rank=0](ladder?rank=0)
* THe same goes for the profile's combat log: [https://kingdombattles.net/profile?log=0](profile?log=0)

Known Bugs:

* Someone's gold was negative. It's been corrected, but the cause is unknown.
* The ladder and profile flicker while the lists are being loaded.

Today's goal:

* Get some minor features working.
