So changes I'm making today:

* Both incoming and outgoing combats are now visible.
* Google analytics implemented.
* The game ladder can now point to a specific rank with the URL: [https://kingdombattles.net/ladder?rank=0](ladder?rank=0)

Known Bugs:

* Someone's gold was negative. I have no idea how this happened.

Today's goal:

* Get some minor features working.
