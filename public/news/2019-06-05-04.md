We've Had Our First Crash!
---
_5 June 2019_

I don't know who, but a newbie looked at their empty combat log, and crashed the whole site. Thankfully, someone notified me, and I got it running again really fast, and hotfixed the issue.

There is another issue I want to address as well: The gold supply. Basically, the gold sinks are bigger than the faucets, and this is making it hard to generate gold. Also, since the average is above 100, every new player reduces the average as well. I don't want to inject gold artificially, as this will make it unfair for newer players who join just after.

Instead, I'm going to be tweaking the speed of the game's "gold tick", or how fast recruits generate gold. I've already reduced it to 20 minutes, in the hopes that the average balances out and increases. The exact duration will be visible in the instructions on the profile page, under "recruits".
