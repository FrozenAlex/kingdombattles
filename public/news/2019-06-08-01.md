Sorry!

The badge offer is now officially closed. The alpha tester badge will no longer be awarded to new players. A massive thank you to the 255 players who signed up within the first month of development!

As for newer players, don't fret, other badges will be awarded as time progresses, including rare and exclusive ones.

I'll begin coding the badges in the morning, so hopefully they'll become available within a day or two (perhaps with placeholder graphics).
