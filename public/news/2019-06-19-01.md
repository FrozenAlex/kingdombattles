It's Freezing In Here!

_19 June 2019_

I've frozen the gold tick due to the recent surge in the gold supply. This is a temporary measure, as I'm hoping it'll drop to a more reasonable level as players do their thing.

I'm hoping to pull another all nighter tonight, simply because I do my best work at night. I'm also planning on releasing "content updates" every Sunday my time to keep everyone entertained. I'll try to add _something_ new gameplay-wise every week.

I've also noticed that the active player count has dropped to a worryingly low level, but this is because I haven't been advertising this game. I plan to post this across reddit again, so... new players inbound, hopefully.

I need to pull myself out of this comfy bed.
