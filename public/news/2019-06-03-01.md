So Stylish, Darling!

_3 June 2019_

I began today working on some styling - you'll notice it most in the [game ladder](/ladder), [combat logs](/combatlog) and [equipment page](/equipment). I've also removed these from the [task list](/tasklist). I'm paying special attention to the mobile (cell phone) layout, since at least 10% of players use mobiles to play.

I've also written some basic instructions for using each of the existing unit types (spies will come soon). I'll eventually add more to it as I implement new features.

I'm wondering what sort of events I could host using as minimal coding as possible. Badges could serve for capture the flag... what else? I'm open to feedback - tweet me or join my discord and let me know!
