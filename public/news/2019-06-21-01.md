Testing... 1, 2, 3, TESTING!

Warning: Boring backend discussion.

Last night, I began working on a testing framework for the website as a whole. I'm using Karma, Jasmine and Istanbul, which should give me a good view of the code as I write tests and refactor it as I go along. I've created a separate branch of development to do all of the testing, so the current production build of the game won't have partially complete refactoring to worry about.

I'm hoping to just switch out the current build for the refactored build within a week or so, altgough that is definitely a lot of work for me. On the upside, I at least know a lot more about what I need to do now.

I know I promised to push a gameplay update every monday, but that's unrealistic at this point.

In other news, I might be getting a new coder to help out on a volunteer basis - nothing is set in stone yet, and they won't start until after the refactoring is done. But I'm looking forward to having some extra help.
