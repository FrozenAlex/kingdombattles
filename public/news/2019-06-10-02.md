Ladder Equation
---
_10 June 2019_

attackerScore = combats you've won as attacker where your force <= (defender force x (undefended ? 0.25 : 1))  
defenderScore = combats you've won as defender  
rankWeight = (soldiers x 5 + recruits + scientists + spies) + (attackerScore + defenderScore) / 10 + gold / 10;  
ladderRank = position in rankWeight compared to all other players  

This is the new equation for the game ladder. I hope this helps people enjoy the game a little more.
