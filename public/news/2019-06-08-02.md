Badger, Badger, Badger!

I spent *way too long* getting the badge to sit next to my username. But, badges are working. Just after I post this, I'll grant everyone who is eligible their "Alpha Tester" badge. To access it, see the "Your Badges" link in the side panel.

There are five badges so far, but I need to actually code in the triggers for the rest. I'll probably do this tomorrow.

Sadly, I don't think my fancy rainbox text will work with the badge component hogging it's spot. If I want rainbow usernames, I'll need to code a hybrid component...

Edit: I've added a [badge list page](/badges/list) for easy perusal.
