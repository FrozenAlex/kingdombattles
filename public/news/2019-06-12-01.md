OK. I've got a lot of work to do in a very short span of time.

I have things such as database backup systems to build, laws to research, and sage advice to seek out. I want to ensure that I'm competent enough to manage this game's operation, and to serve the playerbase to the best of my ability.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
