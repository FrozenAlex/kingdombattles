This account violates rule #1 (attacks an individual) and likely rule #3 (multiple accounts). But honestly I deserve it. I won't ban them unless I find that they are in violation of rule #3.

I need to get some professional help to improve the state of the game - a lot of behind the scenes work, so new features may slow down for a while.
