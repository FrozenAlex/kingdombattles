<div class="break" />

This is a resource accumulation game, with some similarities to idle games. The idea is that you recruit new units once per day, train them as soldiers, and send them to attack other players. You can also train spies and scientists, which each grant their own benefits.

The goal of the game is to be at the top of the game ladder for as long as possible.

### Recruits

<div class="break" />

Untrained recruits gain you 1 gold piece evey half hour - the only unit type that grants a passive income. They also act as a defense force when your soldiers are away, but they have lower combat skills. When recriuts are attacked, it is marked as "undefended" in the combat log. Recruits can still use equipment.

### Soldiers

<div class="break" />

Soldiers are your bread and butter unit in this game. They are experts at combat, and as such are much stronger than recruits. They are used to raid other player's kingdoms for gold, but larger attack forces tend to suffer casualties due to battle. Combat takes time - 1 minute for every soldier that you have. During combat, soldiers will not be available to defend your kingdom. They also use any equipment that you've purchased.

### Scientists

<div class="break" />

Scientists don't fight. Instead, they offer other means of gaining advantage over other players, such as granting access to equipment. Equipment such as weapons boost and attacking force's strength, while armour boosts the defending force. Consumables are also usable by both attackers and defenders.
