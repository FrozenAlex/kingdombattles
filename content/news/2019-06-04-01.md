Today's Tasks Completed

_4 June 2019_

* Improved the instructions.
* Disable attack button with no soldiers.
* Added credentials to attack status requests (others can't spoof to see who you're attacking anymore - my bad!)
* Began work on spying infrastructure.
* Made the attack button more generic - can reuse a lot of attack code for spying code.
* Added credentials to the combat logs (How did I miss TWO credential requirements?)
* Spying is partially working, equipment is proving to be a challenge.
* Paused for the night.
