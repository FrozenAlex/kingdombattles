Equipment Is Finished And Implmented
---
_2 June 2019_

I wanted to do a big fanfare post, but it's 3:30am and I'm too tired. I really gotta stop staying up all night.

Right, the numbers I posted the other day have been changed, and I'm keeping the exact specifications secret. Just know that weapons help attackers, armour helps defenders, and consumables help both. Also, consumables, as their name suggests, are used up once you use them.

Each soldier can use either one weapon or armour AND a consumable.

Also, more expensive equipment is generally better, and consumables are way better than weapons and armour.

Going to bed now. Good night!
