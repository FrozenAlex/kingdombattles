1 Month Of Work
---
_5 June 2019_

According to my commit history, I started work on Kingdom Battles on 7th of May 2019. That means two days from now will be the one month anniversary. I want to thank everyone who has signed up and supported this game!

Everyone who signs up, or has signed up by the end of the 7th (Australian Eastern Standard Time) will receive an exclusive badge, once badges are implemented. This badge will never be awarded to anyone else. <span style="color:red">You MUST have logged in at least once</span> to be awarded this badge. Players will be able to select one badge they own to be shown next to their names on the game ladder, and all badges will be shown on their profile page.

Now that I think of it, I don't actually have badge graphics yet... if you want to contribute, you can contact me @Ratstail91 via my [discord](https://discord.gg/FQmz8TN). PNG files preferred; the copyright of the badge image will transfer to me, but you'll receive credit.

In the meantime, I'm going to try and finish the equipment stealing mechanism. It posed a real challenge yesterday, so hopefully I can finish it before the anniversary.
