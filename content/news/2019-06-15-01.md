Plans For The Future

_15 June 2019_

7th September 2019.

Let's mark it on the calender: The date of the first game reset. At that point, all existing players will receive the beta tester badge, and the game will be reset to 0. All profiles will be archived and deleted, and you'll have to login to create a new one. Accounts will not be deleted ("accounts" and "profiles" are separate).

At that time, a number of new features will be live. I'm giving myself this time period to finish the planned and requested features (including all badges, PvE, generally more "Things" to do) and at that point I'll send out an email to all existing players to notify them of the reset.

The ultimate goal of the reset is to bring in an influx of new and returning players. I know a lot of the early adopters really don't like the idea of a reset, as they'll lose their progress. However, without new players, the game itself will die. 

I've never made a multiplayer game of this scale before, so this is all new to me. I appreciate everyone who has stuck with me this long, but I understand if this decision causes you to quit the game.

Tonight, I think I'll pull an all-nighter to implement some gameplay-specific badges. Either King Of The Hill, or Capture The Flag, or both. Hopefully these will provide a bit of interesting gameplay for those who stick around.

P.S. Having the flu sucks.
