B-B-Ban Hammer!

_11 June 2019_

I've banned our first "player" today. An obvious troll account that was also created today, with a mildly offensive name.

We shall see if the gap in the database causes issues...

Edit: Also their account, profile, and all information is GONE. I'm not bothering to archive that account.
