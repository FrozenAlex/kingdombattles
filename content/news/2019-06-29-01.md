## Wow The Gold Really Shot Up

_29 June 2019_

The gold tick has been adjusted again, and will automatically go into "semi-freeze" mode when it's above 140 average.

I'm not dead, don't worry. I'm just having motivation issues. I never expected this game to do so well, but now it seems to have dropped off. I'm going to have an official break from this game, maybe about a week, while I sort stuff out IRL. I'll still tweak it and monitor it, but I'm not going to worry about it so hard.

I'm also thinking about open-sourcing this game at some point, although I'd definitely like to finish the refactor first.

My first consideration should be for myself, and the game second - that's the only way I'm going to get through "downswings" in my motivation.

I want to thank everyone who has stuck with me so long. I may not know you personally, but I appreciate every one of you. Thank you so much!
