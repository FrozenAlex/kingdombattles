Equipped And Ready!

_1 June 2019_

So today I've been working on the equipment system. You'll be able to see equipment as soon as you train scientists, although they can't be purchased, and offer no benefits. Yet.

Next up is to make them purchasable, and after that I'll make them effective in combat. The way they'll be used is as such: Soldiers will, one at a time, take the most powerful weapon, armour and consumable, and use those during combat. If you have more weapons than soldiers, than some weapons won't be used. Likewise, if you have more soldiers than weapons, they'll go into battle empty-handed. And so on.

About consumables... I'm not sure if I'll actually keep them as a gameplay mechanic or not. If I do, I'll either boost their power, or lower their cost, or something... balancing is definitely coming eventually.

I'm thinking about implementing legendary items. That is, items that can't be bought or sold, and must be earned through ingame events. I could also implement badges for people to show off as well. But all of this is in the future. I need to get the core gameplay working first.
