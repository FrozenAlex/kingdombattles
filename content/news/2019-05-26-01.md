A New Page Structure
---
_26 May 2019_

I keep wanting to start working on the combat, but I keep getting feedback about the site as a whole. I'm happy to receive it, of course, it just means I'll have to work even harder!

I've removed the forms to the right, and moved them into their own pages. This should make it cleaner to signup and login. I've also added a blurb to the main page, and tweaked the styling so it's not simply a wall of text. Hopefully, it looks better - I really can't tell, since I'm too close to the project.
