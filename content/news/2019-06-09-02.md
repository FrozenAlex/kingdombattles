Well, That Sucked.

I originally intended for potions to be a gold sink, but judgeing from the math they're really unappealing.

I've removed potions from sale, and their no longer visible in the client. They can still be used and stolen though.

I'll work on something else to replace them, but I'm only one man, and there's a lot to do...
